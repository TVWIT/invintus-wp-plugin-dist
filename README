# Invintus WordPress Plugin (Distribution Repo)

This repository contains the **compiled, production-ready version** of the [Invintus WordPress plugin](https://github.com/TVWIT/invintus-wp-plugin).

It is intended solely for distribution via Composer and deployment in WordPress environments. This repository is updated automatically via a build script that:

- Compiles plugin assets (JS/CSS)
- Runs Composer installation (`--no-dev`)
- Pushes a clean, release-ready version of the plugin to this repo
- Tags each version for Packagist/Composer usage

## ⚙️ How to Use via Composer

  "require": {

  },
  "extra": {
    "installer-type": "wordpress-plugin"
  }
}
```

> Make sure you’re using [composer/installers](https://github.com/composer/installers) or [johnpbloch/wordpress](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) for WordPress Composer integration.
